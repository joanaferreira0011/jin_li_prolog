## Description

Jin Li is a turn-based game played on a 7x7 board and the pieces are red/yellow koi(fish) and stones.

The game starts with each player putting 2 Koi on the corners  of their side of the board. Each turn the player can perform one of the two actions:

* Move one of its Koi to an adjancent empty square (ortogonal or diagonal) and place a **stone** in any empty square. If the player runs out of stones then he just moves the Koi without placing stones.

* Jump a Koi over a stone (ortogonal or diagonal), it must land on an empty square adjancent to the stone. 

### Scoring

At the end of each turn the player gets 1 point for each Koi adjacent to the new square of the Koi the player just moved.
First player to reach 10 points wins the game.


## Internal representation of the game

The board is represented as a list of lists (row-wise). The internal values are the following:

* 0 - empty square
* 1 - Red Koi
* 2 - Yellow Koi
* 3 - Stone

The render function then calls the `code/2` predicate to translate them to a human-friendly format:

* 0 -> .
* 1 -> R
* 2 -> Y
* 3 -> *

### Rendering the game

The predicate `print_board/1` takes the board (list of lists) as the an argument. It prints each line recursively and before calling the `print_line/1` predicate it prints the `|` character serving as the leftmost limit of the board.

`print_line/1` calls `print_cell/1` for each cell.

`print_cell/1` uses the predicate `code/2` to convert the internal representation of the game to a more human-readable format. After printing the translated character it appends `|` that serves as cell boundary and the rightmost board limit.
